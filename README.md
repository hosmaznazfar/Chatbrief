1. **Python 3.14+** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Telegram App Credentials** - [Get from my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)
   - `api_id` and `api_hash`

3. **Telegram Bot Token** - Create via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
   - Send `/newbot` to create a new bot
   - Save the bot token

4. **AI Provider API Key** (one of the following):

5. **Your Telegram User ID** - Get from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
   - Send `/start` to get your ID

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Telebrief can be run in Docker for easy deployment. **No Python installation required on host!**

The image is published to GitHub Container Registry on every release:

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/belaytzev/telebrief:latest
```

Available tags: `latest`, `X.Y` (minor), `X.Y.Z` (patch).

```bash
# 1. Create Telegram session (REQUIRED - one-time setup)
./create_session.sh

# 2. Start the service
docker compose up -d

# 3. View logs
docker compose logs -f telebrief
```

The `docker-compose.yml` uses the pre-built GHCR image by default, so no local build step is needed. If you want to build from source instead, replace the `image:` line with `build: .`.

**Important**: You must create the Telegram session file BEFORE running Docker. The script uses Docker itself, so no additional dependencies needed.

## 🤖 Bot Commands

Open Telegram and message your bot:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start` | Show welcome message and available commands |
| `/help` | Display help message with all commands |
| `/digest` | Generate and send digest for last 24 hours (uses configured `digest_mode`) |
| `/status` | Show configuration, next scheduled run, and system info |
| `/cleanup` | Manually delete old digest messages |

---

## 📊 Example Output

Telebrief supports two digest modes configured via `digest_mode` in `config.yaml`.

### Channel mode (`digest_mode: "channel"` — default)

Groups summaries by source channel with clickable channel links:

```markdown
# 📊 Daily Digest — May 2, 2026

## 🎯 Overview

Today's main themes: AI tooling dominated with Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.7
release, crypto markets rallied on spot ETF approvals, EU finalized
amendments to the AI Act.

---

## 💻 TechCrunch

- 🚀 **Claude Opus 4.7 released**: 1M context window, faster output
- 🤖 **OpenAI GPT-6 leak**: Multimodal benchmarks surface early
- 📱 **Apple Vision Pro 2**: Rumored Q3 launch with lighter frame

## 💰 Crypto News

- 📈 **Bitcoin hits $89K**: Spot ETF inflows reach record high
- ⚠️ **SEC settles with Ripple**: Final ruling closes 6-year case
- 🔐 **Ethereum Pectra upgrade**: Mainnet activation confirmed

---
📈 **Stats**: 20 channels, 1,847 messages processed
```

### Topic mode (`digest_mode: "digest"`)

Groups summaries by AI-detected topics. You define topic groups in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
digest_mode: "digest"
digest_groups:
  - name: "Events"
    description: "Conferences, meetups, releases, launches, announcements"
  - name: "News"
    description: "Politics, economy, world affairs, breaking news"
  - name: "Sport"
    description: "Sports results, transfers, tournaments, matches"
```

Messages that don't match any defined group are placed into an automatic "Other" category.

> All labels (header, statistics, bot commands) follow the configured `output_language`. The example above uses English; set `output_language: "Russian"` (or any other language) to change the output.

### `dedup_topics` — cross-channel deduplication

When multiple channels cover the same event, the grouper normally produces one bullet point per channel. Enable `dedup_topics` to instruct the AI to keep only the most informative description and merge the source attributions:

```yaml
settings:
  digest_mode: "digest"
  dedup_topics: true        # default: false
  digest_groups:
    - name: "Tech"
      description: "Technology news and releases"
```

With deduplication enabled, if `TechCrunch` and `HackerNews` both report the same product launch, the digest will contain a single bullet point with `source: "TechCrunch, HackerNews"` instead of two separate entries.

> **Note:** `dedup_topics` has no effect in `digest_mode: "channel"` — deduplication only applies during topic-based grouping.

---

## ⚙️ Per-Channel Configuration

Each channel entry supports two optional overrides in addition to the required `id` and `name` fields.

### `lookback_hours` — per-channel lookback window

Override the global `settings.lookback_hours` for a specific channel. Useful when some channels post infrequently and need a wider collection window, or when you want a tighter window for high-volume channels.

```yaml
channels:
  - id: "@breaking_news"
    name: "Breaking News"
    # no lookback_hours — uses the global settings.lookback_hours

  - id: "@weekly_digest"
    name: "Weekly Newsletter"
    lookback_hours: 168   # look back 7 days for this channel only

  - id: -1001234567890
    name: "High Volume Channel"
    lookback_hours: 6     # only last 6 hours for this channel
```

`lookback_hours` must be a positive integer. If omitted or set to `null`, the global value is used.

### `prompt_extra` — per-channel AI instructions

Append extra instructions to the AI system prompt when summarizing a specific channel. Use this to guide tone, focus, or format for channels that need special treatment.

```yaml
channels:
  - id: "@cryptonews"
    name: "Crypto News"
    prompt_extra: "Focus only on price movements and regulatory news. Ignore opinion pieces."

  - id: "@jobboard"
    name: "Job Board"
    prompt_extra: "Extract only senior engineering roles. Format as a list: Role — Company — Link."
```

`prompt_extra` is appended verbatim to the channel's summarization system prompt. Leave it empty (or omit the field) for standard behavior.

---

## 🗄️ Persistent Storage

By default, Telebrief generates digests on demand without storing raw messages. You can enable a persistent storage layer that saves every collected message to a database for historical access or external LLM workflows.

Storage is **disabled by default** and opt-in via `config.yaml`.

### SQLite (default backend)

No extra setup required. Messages are saved to a local SQLite file.

```yaml
storage:
  enabled: true
  backend: sqlite
  path: data/messages.db   # relative to project root
```

When running in Docker, the `data/` directory is already mounted as a volume in `docker-compose.yml`, so the database persists across container restarts.

### PostgreSQL (optional backend)

Use PostgreSQL for multi-host deployments or when you need concurrent read access to the message store.

```yaml
storage:
  enabled: true
  backend: postgres
  url: "postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname"
```

`asyncpg` is included in the standard dependencies and is installed automatically by `uv sync`. No extra install step is needed.

### Schema

Both backends create the same logical schema on first run (table and index are created automatically — no manual migration needed):

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `channel_name` | text | Channel name from your config |
| `sender` | text | Message author |
| `text` | text | Message body |
| `timestamp` | text / timestamptz | Message timestamp |
| `link` | text | Telegram message link |
| `has_media` | bool / integer | Whether the message has media |
| `media_type` | text | Media type string |
| `collected_at` | text / timestamptz | When the row was inserted |

**Note**: Storage is append-only. Overlapping `lookback_hours` windows across runs will produce duplicate rows for messages collected in both windows.

---

## 🔌 Extensibility

Telebrief exposes four hook surfaces that let you customise behaviour via `config.yaml` without modifying core logic. All new fields are optional — existing configs run unchanged.

### Filters

A filter chain runs after message collection and before storage and summarization. Dropped messages never reach the AI or the database.

Built-in filters live in `src/extensions/filters.py`:

| Filter | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `KeywordFilter` | Keep/drop messages by keyword substring (case-insensitive) |
| `RegexFilter` | Keep or drop messages matching a regex pattern |
| `MinLengthFilter` | Drop messages shorter than a character threshold |

Configure a global filter chain under `settings.filters`. Each entry needs a `class_path` (dotted import path) and an optional `config` dict passed as keyword arguments to the constructor:

```yaml
settings:
  filters:
    - class_path: src.extensions.filters.KeywordFilter
      config:
        include: ["job", "hiring", "remote"]
        exclude: ["nsfw"]
    - class_path: src.extensions.filters.MinLengthFilter
      config:
        min_chars: 30
```

Override the global chain for a single channel by adding `filters:` under that channel entry. Set `filters: []` to disable filtering for that channel entirely, or provide a different list to replace the global chain for that channel only:

```yaml
channels:
  - id: "@jobboard"
    name: "Job Board"
    filters:
      - class_path: src.extensions.filters.RegexFilter
        config:
          pattern: "senior|staff|principal"
          mode: "include"
```

Write your own filter by implementing the `MessageFilter` Protocol:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from src.extensions.filters import MessageFilter
from src.config_loader import ChannelConfig
from src.collector import Message


class MyFilter:
    name = "my_filter"

    def __init__(self, custom_param: str = "") -> None:
        self.custom_param = custom_param

    async def filter(self, channel: ChannelConfig, messages: list[Message]) -> list[Message]:
        return [m for m in messages if self.custom_param in (m.text or "")]
```

Then reference it in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
settings:
  filters:
    - class_path: mypackage.mymodule.MyFilter
      config:
        custom_param: "important"
```

### Prompts

The base prompt template lives in `src/prompts/base_summary.txt`. You can point to a custom template file or plug in a custom `PromptComposer` class.

```yaml
prompts:
  base_template: src/prompts/base_summary.txt  # path to template file
  composer: ""                                  # empty = built-in DefaultComposer
```

The built-in `DefaultComposer` assembles the final system prompt in this order (empty parts are skipped):

```text
base template (with {language} substituted)
  + group.prompt_extra  (if channel belongs to a group with prompt_extra set)
  + channel.prompt_extra  (if non-empty)
```

To use a custom composer, implement the `PromptComposer` Protocol and set `composer` to its dotted path:

```python
from src.config_loader import ChannelConfig, DigestGroupConfig
from src.extensions.prompts import PromptComposer


class MyComposer:
    def __init__(self, base_template: str, language: str) -> None:
        self._base = base_template
        self._language = language

    def compose(self, channel: ChannelConfig, group: DigestGroupConfig | None) -> str:
        return f"{self._base}\nRespond in {self._language}."
```

> **Note:** The constructor must accept `(base_template: str, language: str)` as its first two positional arguments. A mismatched signature raises a `TypeError` at startup with a descriptive message.

```yaml
prompts:
  composer: mypackage.mymodule.MyComposer
```

### Group binding

Channels can be bound to a `digest_groups` entry. The group's `prompt_extra` is then injected into every channel in that group, before the channel's own `prompt_extra`.

```yaml
settings:
  digest_groups:
    - name: "Jobs"
      description: "Job listings and hiring announcements"
      prompt_extra: "Extract only role title, company, and link. Format as a list."

channels:
  - id: "@techleads_jobs"
    name: "Tech Jobs"
    group: Jobs          # must match a digest_groups name or "Other"
    prompt_extra: "Focus on senior and staff-level positions only."
```

Channels without a `group` field (or `group: null`) use the base template and their own `prompt_extra` only.

### Storage queries

When storage is enabled (`storage.enabled: true`), the `StorageBackend` exposes a `query_messages` read API for external tooling:

```python
from src.storage import SQLiteBackend
from datetime import datetime, timezone

backend = SQLiteBackend("data/messages.db")
await backend.initialize()

messages = await backend.query_messages(
    channel_name="TechCrunch",  # the configured channels[*].name (NOT the @id)
    since=datetime(2026, 4, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    until=datetime(2026, 4, 30, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    limit=500,
)
```

All parameters are optional. `channel_name` matches the human-readable `channels[*].name` value from `config.yaml` (this is the value persisted to the `channel_name` column at collection time); omit it to query across all channels. Renaming a channel in config will change the value stored for new rows — historical rows keep the old name. Results are ordered by timestamp descending and capped at `limit` (default 1000, must be ≥ 1).

## 🔗 MCP Server

Telebrief can expose its digests over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so an MCP client (Claude Code, for example) can request a digest directly instead of reading it in Telegram.

The server runs **inside the Telebrief process**, sharing its Telegram session, configuration and generation lock with the scheduler and the bot. Digests it returns are byte-for-byte what Telegram receives, including topic grouping and deduplication.

### Enabling it

```yaml
mcp:
  enabled: true
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 8765
  path: "/mcp"
```

Then register it with your client:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http telebrief http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
```

### Tools

| Tool | Arguments | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| `get_digest` | `hours` (1–168, default 24) | Generates a fresh digest. Takes 20–90 seconds and spends AI provider tokens. |
| `get_last_digest` | — | Returns the most recent digest from cache, with its generation time. Instant and free. |
| `get_channel_messages` | `channel`, `hours` (1–168, default 24), `limit` (1–500, default 200) | Returns the individual messages of one channel, unsummarized. No AI tokens spent. |

Every successful digest — scheduled, bot-triggered or MCP-triggered — is cached to `data/last_digest.json`, so `get_last_digest` serves the same digest that was delivered to Telegram.

Digest generation is serialized: if the scheduler is already building a digest, an MCP call waits for it to finish rather than opening a second Telegram session.

### Reading a single channel

`get_channel_messages` answers "what was actually posted in this channel", as opposed to the AI summary a digest gives you.

`channel` accepts either form from `config.yaml` — the human-readable `channels[*].name` or the `channels[*].id` (`@username` or numeric) — matched case-insensitively. An unknown value fails with the list of configured channel names, so no separate discovery call is needed.

The tool reads from persistent storage when it is enabled and holds messages for the requested window, and falls back to a live Telegram read otherwise. The response header states which path was used:

```text
channel: AI News (from storage, 42 msgs, last 24h)

[2026-08-07T09:12:04+00:00] Alice
OpenAI released a new model...
https://t.me/ainews/1234

[2026-08-07T10:30:11+00:00] Bob
[photo] Benchmark chart
https://t.me/ainews/1235
```

Messages come back in chronological order; `limit` keeps the newest ones and drops the oldest. The live fallback runs under the same generation lock as digests and applies the channel's configured [filters](#filters), so both paths return the same set of messages.

Two deliberate differences from digest generation:

- `channels[*].lookback_hours` is **not** applied — the tool honours the `hours` the caller asked for.
- Media-only messages arrive as their placeholder text (`[photo]`, `[video]`), exactly as they are stored.

### Security

**The MCP server has no authentication.** It relies on binding to loopback, where the SDK also enables DNS-rebinding protection. Anyone who can reach the port can trigger digest generation and read your channel summaries.

Keep `host` on `127.0.0.1`. Telebrief logs a warning at startup if you bind anywhere else. In Docker, publish the port as `127.0.0.1:8765:8765` rather than exposing it on all interfaces, and put it behind a firewall or reverse proxy with auth if you genuinely need remote access.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I change the output language?**
A: Yes! Set `output_language` in `config.yaml` to any language (e.g., "English", "Spanish", "Chinese").

**Q: How many channels can I monitor?**
A: Tested up to 50 channels. Performance depends on message volume.

**Q: Can multiple users receive digests?**
A: Currently single-user only. Multi-user support would require database and additional auth logic.

**Q: Does it work with group chats?**
A: Yes! Add group chat IDs to `config.yaml` the same way as channels.

**Q: How do I switch to topic-based digests?**
A: Set `digest_mode: "digest"` in `config.yaml` and define your `digest_groups`. Each group has a `name` and `description` that guides the AI classification. An implicit "Other" group catches anything that doesn't match.

**Q: Can I customize the digest format?**
A: Yes! Edit `src/formatter.py` to change Markdown structure, emojis, and sections.

**Q: How much does it cost to run?**
A: With OpenAI GPT-5-nano: ~$0.30/month. With Ollama: free (runs locally). Anthropic pricing varies by model.

**Q: Can I use a local AI model?**
A: Yes! Set `ai_provider: "ollama"` in config.yaml and install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) on your machine.
